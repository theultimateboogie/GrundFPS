GrundFPS
========

Simple. Easy. Fun.

GrundFPS removes the hassle of trying to play first person shooters.
If you stick to official services, you won't find any missing map errors, missing textures, or any problems like that.
You don't have to download anything besides the game itself.

It. just. works.

Anyone can play.

Why should I play this instead of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch?
========

For one thing, GrundFPS offers the same fast-paced action that HL2: DM offers, but with a 100% discount; in other words, GrundFPS is free, HL2: DM isn't. GrundFPS doesn't have the hassle of downloading maps and missing textures that occur with custom content.

But I like custom content!
========
Don't worry. You can submit content you want to us and we'll add it to the game eventually (most likely).

Don't want to submit to us? Okay. You can defeat the purpose of GrundFPS by going to options, clicking advanced, enable the developer console, and press ~, then type connect (IP of server with custom content here), and press enter to join a server you know of that has the custom content you want.

Can I host a server for you guys?
========
Yes, we need someone to host, actually. Contact me at wrenched@rbaa.site.nfoservers.com.
