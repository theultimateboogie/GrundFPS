GrundFPS
========

Simple. Easy. Fun.

GrundFPS removes the hassle of trying to play first person shooters.
If you stick to official services, you won't find any missing map errors, missing textures, or any problems like that.

It. just. works.

Anyone can play.


Current Status
========
Early stages of development. The first dev release should come out this week or so.

Final releases will be in an installer package.

Cutting Edge
========
Want to try a Cutting Edge version of GrundFPS (very unstable) right now? Go to http://github.com/theultimateboogie/GrundFPS_CuttingEdge and follow the instructions!
Please note: Cutting Edge is not the final product. Many features may be added or removed over time. Cutting Edge is nowhere near the final product.
